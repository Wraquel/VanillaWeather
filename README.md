Hello!

My activity  was to design and code a weather app for desktop displaying the forecast for the next days. Thinking about the user experience and improve my code skills, I developed a project beyond what was proposed, by installing also a current location button and a local time reference that interacts with a background color change for day/night. 

Languages/Framework: HTML5, CSS3, API, Javascript.
